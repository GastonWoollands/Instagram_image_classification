# Instagram_image_classification
The primary objective of this project is to leverage the Instagram API to extract insightful information from multiple user accounts. The focus is on analyzing images to determine their performance metrics and understand the factors contributing to their success. By delving into the details of each image, the project aims to uncover patterns, preferences, and trends, shedding light on the factors influencing their popularity. Through the utilization of Instagram API functionalities, we gather comprehensive data that allows us to discern which images excel and the underlying reasons behind their success. This exploration serves not only to enhance our understanding of image dynamics but also to inform strategies for optimizing content and maximizing engagement on the platform.
